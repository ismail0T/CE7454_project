Sleep stages classification using EEG signals, a deep learning approach.

Sleep stages classification is important for measuring the sleep quality as it significantly affects the quality of daily life and it helps in finding out sleep disorders. A lot of studies have been made in this field but most of them used hand-crafted features extraction which may lead to less accurate classification results and longer processing time. However, some new deep learning models can also be deployed to achieve better accuracy and faster results.

Our effort in this project will start by exploring and exploiting a public sleep EEG dataset.Next, we will start building our deep learning models and evaluate them.
